# SangerSeqAlign
Aligns sanger sequencing read files (.abi) to a plasmid reference file (.gb) and returns useful information for each read like % match, which strand the match was on, and which features (coding sequences, primers, etc.) are contained within the alignment

Use this program to obtain quick information regarding the alignment of multiple sanger sequencing reads to a genbank file containing the reference information of a plasmid of interest. Useful for determining if cloning of inserts into a plasmid was successful. To use click "Runtime -> Run All" and then follow the prompts. The reference file must be a singular genbank (.gb) file and the sanger read(s) must be in .abi format. Once the code finishes, a fasta file containing the sequences of strong reads will be downloaded. Additionally, an excel file containing the names of the reads, the % matched bps of each read, the strand matched to, and the relevant features from the reference plasmid matched.
